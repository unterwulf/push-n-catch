Push-n-Catch has no external dependencies. To build it you just need an
appropriate C compiler and the make program.

POSIX (Linux/OpenBSD)
---------------------

    make HOST=posix

Binaries will be placed into build/posix. Install target is also provided.
Default PREFIX is /usr/local/bin, so you will probably want to override it.

    make HOST=posix PREFIX=/usr/bin install

Win32
-----
Currently MinGW32 cross-compiler i686-w64-mingw32-gcc should be used to build
win32 version. Buiding under Windows is not supported.

    make HOST=win32

Binaries will be placed into build/win32.

DOS16
-----
DOS real-mode version is based on WatTCP networking library (included into
the distribution) and as a result of this Push-n-Catch must be built using
a Borland compiler (obviously under DOS or Windows). The makefile has Borland
syntax and only appropriate for Borland make.

    cd dos
    make

Binaries will be placed into dos.
